# Scrypta News Feed

Scrypta News Feed is a basic system that allows users to read from trusted sources.

Everyone can publish directly on it using the web app here https://news.scryptachain.org.

Publications can be done in two ways:

- Manually: you have to copy / paste your article from your local computer and save it
- Automatically: you have to "attach" a valid RSS feed through the web form. This web form will communicate with our https://github.com/scryptachain/scrypta-news-engine and will give you a deposit address. Each automatic notarization will cost 1 LYRA (including fees) and it's done in background each 3 minutes.

This system is still a WIP, however it's fully working and right now there are two trusted publishers:
- Scrypta Foundation (https://medium.com/@scryptachain)
- CryptoRivista (https://cryptorivista.com)
